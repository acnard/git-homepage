# git-homepage
code and content for personal home page published at annanardella.it

## initial setup
1. create the empty git-homepage repository on github
2. on local machine, do a git clone of this repository, so I end up with an empty git-homepage folder there as well. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59955581/144261137-f54bbd21-99a2-4c2d-97bd-d73f7b368ef1.png)

3. on local machine, copy into the git-homepage folder all the website files (from the 2019 home page folder)
4. do git add -A, git commit and finally git-push to get the starting codebase on the remote as well

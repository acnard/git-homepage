<h2 class="subtitle centred"> a cellular automaton </h2>

<h3>Description:</h3>
<p>
Langton's ant is a cellular automaton (See the <a href="#notes">Notes</a> at the bottom of this page for more on cellular automata) which poses a problem that is currently baffling mathematicians. The ant lives by three simple rules:
</p>
<ul class="rules">
<li>If it is on a yellow cell it makes a 90° turn to the left. </li>
<li>If it is on a grey cell it makes a 90° turn to the right. </li>
<li>As it moves to the next square, the one that it is on changes colour from yellow to grey, or the reverse.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The result is a quite complicated and apparently chaotic motion... but after about ten thousand moves the ant locks into a cycle of 104 moves which causes it to build a broad diagonal "highway". What's more, the ant seems to always build the highway (though nobody has been able to <em>prove</em> this yet) even if "obstacles" of yellow squares are scattered in its path, provided it finds enough grey squares on the periphery. Try it out yourself in the applet below.

<h3>Quick Start:</h3>
<p>
Just click <span class="math">Start</span> and watch the ant run around - the "highway" appears after about 10,000 moves.
</p>

<h3>Instructions: </h3>
<p>
The ant's initial direction is North. Click <span class="math">Next</span> to walk it through a few moves, and satisfy yourself that it follows the rules described above. <em>(N.B. ant shown dark grey when on a grey square, and orange when on a yellow square)</em>
</p>
<p>
Then click <span class="math">Start</span> and look out for the highway. To see how it behaves with an obstacle click <span class="math">AddObstacle</span>.

<h3 id="notes">Notes:</h3>
<p>
A <em>cellular automaton</em> is a grid of cells which switch to different states (in this case yellow and grey) according to a  specific set of rules. Langton's ant (named after its inventor, mathematician Christopher Langton) is one of the simplest cellular automata. For a more complex example of a cellular automaton see the <a href="life.html">Conway's Game of Life</a> applet on this site .

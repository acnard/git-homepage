<h1 class="centred">Out of Order, Chaos</h1>
<h2 class="centred subtitle"><em>iteration of kx<sup>2</sup>-1</em></h2>


<h3 id="description">Description:</h3>
<p>
 In his book <cite>Does God Play Dice?</cite>, mathematician Ian Stewart describes how iteration of a very simple equation can 
 produce an extremely complex chaotic output . (See the <a href="#notes">notes</a>
 for an explanation of what iteration means). 
</p>
<p>For example, if you iterate <span class="math">x<sup>2</sup>-1</span>, with a starting value of <span class="math">x<sub>0</sub>=0.54321</span>
 (try this in the applet by entering <span class="math">k=1</span> and then hitting the <span class="math">Enter</span> key), you get a cyclic output that oscillates regularly 
 between 0 and -1. However if you do the same thing with <span class="math">2x<sup>2</sup>-1</span> (in the applet, enter <span class="math">k=2</span> and then hit the <span class="math">Enter</span> key), you'll
 find that the resulting output doesn't seem to follow any kind of pattern, and in fact looks random. You can use the  <span class="math">&lt;</span> and  <span class="math">&gt;</span> buttons to explore how the output continues to the right and left, and see for yourself that it never seems to settle down into any kind of regular behaviour.

</p>

<p> 
Another interesting thing to try with <span class="math">2x<sup>2</sup>-1</span> is to change the starting value of <span class="math">x</span> ever so slightly, 
say by setting it to <span class="math">0.543211</span> instead of <span class="math">0.54321</span>. You'll see that a tiny change in the starting value produces a 
completely different output.
</p>
<p>Ian Stewart suggests many other fascinating possibilities. If you put <span class="math">k=1.4</span> you get a complicated cycle 
through thirty two different values. Chaos sets in around <span class="math">k=1.5</span>. After that, it seems that the bigger you make <span class="math">k</span>, 
the more chaotic things get... or do they? At <span class="math">k=1.74</span> you see well-developed chaos, but <span class="math">k=1.75</span> unexpectedly settles
down into an orderly cycle.
</p>
<p> <q>Out of chaos emerges pattern. The two are inextricably related.</q> Go to the <a href="#chaos">applet</a> and see for yourself.
</p>

<h3>Instructions: </h3>
<p>
This applet iterates <span class="math">kx<sup>2</sup>-1</span> for any choice of <span class="math">k</span> and starting value of <span class="math">x</span>.  Type your chosen values into the text boxes, then hit the <span class="math">Enter</span> key or click the <span class="math">Iterate</span> button to plot the graph.
</p>
<p>The graph and list display the results of 300 
iterations starting from the <q>show from</q> value. To see the next 300 iterations just click the <span class="math">&gt;</span> button, and conversely click <span class="math">&lt;</span> to view the previous 300 iterations. You can also type in your choice of <q>show from</q> value.
</p>
<p>
Clicking on an item in the result list highlights the corresponding point on the graph and, conversely, clicking on a point of the graph will select the corresponding item in the list.  Use the <span class="math">Up</span> and <span class="math">Down</span> arrow keys to scroll through the values in the result list, higlighting the corresponding point on the graph each time.

<h3 id="notes">Notes:</h3>
<p>
<em>Iteration</em> means doing the same thing over and over again. 
Suppose you want to iterate the operation <span class="math">x<sup>2</sup></span>.
 You have to start somewhere, so you might choose an initial value:
<span class="math">x<sub>0</sub>= 2</span>.  Plug this value into the original equation and you get: <span class="math">2<sup>2</sup> = 4 </span>. 
 Let this answer be your <em>new</em> value of x : <span class="math">x<sub>1</sub>= 4</span>. 
 Plug the new value of  <span class="math">x</span> back into the equation to get the next answer: <span class="math">x<sub>2</sub>= 4<sup>2</sup> = 16 </span>.
 Continue plugging the answers back into the equation and you'll get: <br />
 <span class="math">x<sub>3</sub>= 16<sup>2</sup>  = 256</span><br />
 <span class="math">x<sub>4</sub>= 256<sup>2</sup>  = 65536</span><br />
 <span class="math">x<sub>5</sub>= 65536<sup>2</sup>  = 4294967296</span><br />
... and so on. Clearly this particular iteration is going to shoot off toward infinity pretty quickly, but there are others which do 
more interesting things. Go back to the <a href="#description">Description</a> to read about them.
